Perfect ✅ I’ll expand the README with more explanation but still keep it clear and easy to read. Here’s the improved version you can copy:

# 📝 AI To-Do List  

This is a **Django-based To-Do List application** with **AI integration**.  
It allows you to manage tasks and also use **AI-powered assistance** (via Ollama) to interact with your task list.  

The project uses:  
- **Django** → for the main web application  
- **Celery** → for background task processing  
- **Redis** → as a message broker for Celery  
- **Ollama** → for running AI models locally  

---

## 🚀 Setup  

### 1. Clone the repository  
Download the project to your computer:  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-name>

2. Install Python dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed. Then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install and run Redis

Redis is required for Celery to handle background tasks.

For Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server


Start Redis:

redis-server

4. Install Ollama

Ollama is used to run AI models locally. Follow the official instructions from Ollama’s site.

For Linux:

curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh


To test if Ollama is working, run:

ollama serve 

▶️ Running the App

You will need 3 separate terminals:

Terminal 1 – Django development server

python manage.py runserver


Terminal 2 – Celery worker

celery -A your_project_name worker -l info


Terminal 3 – Ollama server

ollama run <model-name>


(example: ollama run llama2)

✅ Usage

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Add, update, or delete tasks in your To-Do list.

The AI (powered by Ollama) can help you analyze and organize your tasks.

Background jobs (like scheduling or AI-related processing) are handled by Celery + Redis.

📌 Notes

Make sure Redis, Ollama, and Celery are running before using the app.

You can change the AI model by replacing <model-name> with the model you want (e.g., llama2, mistral, etc.).

This project is for learning and experimenting with AI + Django + Celery integration.


Do you want me to also add **screenshots / demo section** so your GitHub README looks more attractive to recruiters?
